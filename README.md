# Datadome Cookie Generator - 4.6.0

- This an open source of the Datadome cookie generator that i've used on Roland Garros to pass the block and make requests.

- It will generate you a Datadome cookie that you need to requests a site using this anti-bot solution.

- Might be deprecated as they update payload very often..
 


## Installation

All you have to do is : 

- Input your domain at `line 3`
- Edit payload if needed (if your site doesn't use 4.6.0 or if they have another payload than this one).
